### Design problem statements
#### statement one (1)

> I am an individual trying to move from one location to the other but access to  public transportation isn't easy and very uncomfortable because most of these vehicles are crowded and not enough to cater to all pedestrians which makes me feel stressed, uncomfortable and very unsafe.

#### statement two (2)
> I am an individual trying to make money by offering taxi services but high commission fees on the existing taxi hailing companies make it difficult to make any profit and this makes me feel a bit hopeless because i have to work long hours just to make a little profit.
