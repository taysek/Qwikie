# **Qwikie - a ride-sharing platform**

### ***Qwikie's business model***

> Qwikie will work as a digital aggregator platform that connects passengers who need a ride from location A to location B with drivers that are willing to serve them.
> The passengers generate the demand, drivers supply the demand and Qwikie will act as the facilitator to make this all happen seamlessly on mobile platform.

### **Qwikie's value proposition for drivers**

* Flexibility to drive on their own terms

### **Revenue generation**

> Qwikie is a freeware mobile app and so does not require any payment for downloads but may accept in-app purchases/payments which will be subject to commission deduction from the various app stores.

* #### **Trip commissions** 
  Qwikie will provide the drivers on its platform (also known as partners) with a robust supply of ride requests to accept, fulfill, and make income. While making a booking, the passenger pays Qwikie for the ride through the app. Qwikie then transfers the payment to the partnerâ€™s account after taking some amount of commission for doing the job of a broker.
  The commission rates may vary from 15-20% depending on the market.

* #### **Cancellation fee**
  If a passenger cancels a ride after a certain time-frame, say five minutes, he/she is charged a cancellation fee.

* #### **Brand partnerships/advertisements**
  The aim is to get Qwikie a high ranking on the popularity scale in the central west african region with thousands of active users every day. This will make it a good option for brands to do advertisements. The app interface will push feed style layout for intuitive content consumption. Over time, it may go on to become a strong revenue source by becoming a channel for sponsored content.


### **Last point: Expanding rapidly with new business verticals** ###
Recently mobile usage is increased like anything, so it's an opportunity for us owners/Planners/Developers to make some beautiful quality apps and to succeed in own way. Qwikie can become more than just a ridesharing platform and has a tremendous potential to generate massive revenue to fuel our ambitions.
