***How much do Qwikie get per download on Playsote/Appsote.***

You will be paid on every downloads only when your app is a paid app. In that case, Google will take 30% cut on the 
purchase price and add the remaining to your Google merchant account. Once you cross the $100 threshold at the end of a month, 
the available balance in your merchant account will be transferred to your provided bank account by 16th of every month, and 
$99 for iOS AppStore with 1 year validity.

### Example ###
If your app is priced at €1 at Google Play Store, for each download o fthe app, we'll get €0.70 and Google will take €0.30.


If your app is a free app, you won't be paid for the app downloads from Google Play. You need to use some monetisation strategies
to make money through your app. Few of the common strategies are.

- Integrate ads in your app.
- Integrate in-app purchase for digital goods like game coins, gems and new avatars.
- Provide services like movie ticket booking and charge service fee for that.

There are many other ways to earn money through apps. Search for something that fits for your app and utilise it.

Recently mobile usage is increased like anything, so it's an opportunity for us owners/Planners/Developers to make some beautiful quality apps and to succeed in their way. All the very best if you are planning to do something!
