# Qwikie-
***How much do Qwikie get per download on Playsote/Appsote.***

Qwikie will be paid on every downloads only when the app is a paid app. In that case, Google will take 30% cut on the 
purchase price and add the remaining to Qwikie Google merchant account. Hence we cross $100 threshold at the end of a month, 
the available balance in the merchant account will be transferred to company’s provided bank account by 16th of every month, and 
$99 for iOS AppStore with 1 year validity.

### Example ###
If the app is priced at €1 at Google Play Store, for each download o fthe app, we'll get €0.70 and Google will take €0.30.


If Qwikie app is a free app, it won't be paid for the app downloads from Google Play. Instead, we'll need to use some monetisation strategies to make money through the app. 

Few of the common strategies are:

- Integrate ads in your app.
- Integrate in-app purchase for digital goods like game coins, gems and new avatars.
- Provide services like movie ticket booking and charge service fee for that.

There are many other ways to earn money through apps. Search for something that fits for your app and utilise it.

### Last point: ###
Recently mobile usage is increased like anything, so it's an opportunity for us owners/Planners/Developers to make some beautiful quality apps and to succeed in their way. All the very best if you are planning to do something!
